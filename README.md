# Mage-Escape
This is a short 2D platformer that I made in 10 days for the "Shovel Jam" game jam event. I worked solo on this project with the restriction I put on myself that I had to create any assets used inside this game, without getting any from online. The game is in a "completed" state with 3 short levels to play through. There are some issues that I would go back and fix such as some enemies' collisions counting twice for damage or some weird player physics issues that could be ironed out. And it definitely isn't optimized, but that wasn't the point. However, for the restriction I put on myself and the time alloted to me I am happy with the outcome.

The looping music was composed by a personal friend of mine that decided to remain anonymous.
I also use several tutorials/guides for certain game systems.
